# EternalReturnPath

**EternalReturnPath** is a Python-based tool designed to generate efficient item routes for the game *Eternal Return*. Players must navigate across 18+ unique locations to gather resources and craft powerful weapons and armor before engaging other competitors. Completing your build quickly provides a significant tactical advantage — and this program helps you do exactly that.

It prompts users to input their desired build and then searches a Firebase database for item data and crafting components. From there, it analyzes all available map zones and determines the fastest possible scavenging route, telling you exactly where to go and what items to collect.

## Project Goal

One of my goals in developing this tool was to deepen my understanding of database architecture and design. In past collaborative projects, I encountered frustration when working with disorganized or opaque data structures built by teammates. With this project, I set out to build a clean, well-structured database that allows for intuitive data retrieval and efficient program logic — and I'm proud of the result.
